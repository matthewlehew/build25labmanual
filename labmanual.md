## Welcome to Your Lab Environment

(And this is a test string to make sure it's pulling correctly.)

To begin, log into the virtual machine using the following credentials: +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Password+++

**Note:** Text formatted as an +++example+++ represents type text. Clicking on this text will automatically insert it to prevent any typing errors.

To edit the lab manual, click the hamburger menu in the top-right corner and select **"Edit Instructions"**. This will open the editor where you can modify the instructions.

Instructions are written in Markdown. For detailed guidance on syntax, please refer to the following documentation:

[Creating Instructions with Markdown Syntax](https://docs.skillable.com/docs/creating-instructions-with-markdown-syntax)

If you want to manage your instructions outside of Skillable Studio like Github, please refer to the following documentation:

[Manage Instructions Outside of Studio](https://docs.skillable.com/docs/manage-instructions-outside-of-studio)

For saving changes made to the virtual machine, please refer to this guide:  

[Committing Changes to a Virtual Machine](https://docs.skillable.com/docs/committing-changes-to-a-lab)

**Note:** When prompted, select **"Commit my changes and update this lab profile"** to ensure your changes are saved.

Changes made to the virtual machine will take effect immediately after committing. You may restart the lab instance if you wish to view these changes.

**Note:** Changes to the instructions will be saved automatically, so the commit process applies only to modifications to the virtual machine.
